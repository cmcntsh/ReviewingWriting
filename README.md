# Reviewing Writing

This is some information about what I'm usually looking for when reviewing student academic writing.

### Here are the things I’m looking for: 

* Section Content (appropriate and complete)
* Evidence (citations used when summarizing, paraphrasing, or quoting)
* APA (spelling, grammar, headings, citation formatting, reference formatting, tables, figures, appendices)
* Logic and Flow (well-formed paragraphs, topic sentences, suitable transitions, logical arrangement, clearly written sentences)

### Highlighting:

$\colorbox{lightgreen}{Looks good}$ - Things I highlight in green I generally find acceptable.

${\color{orange}Fix \space problem}$ - Things I highlight in yellow I think something needs to be fixed.

${\color{gray}In \space general \space I'll \space use \space some \space basic \space highlighting \space to \space denote \space sections \space I've \space reviewed.}$ Topic sentences of paragraphs will be highlighted in gray. ${\color{lightgreen}Elements \space that \space look \space good \space to \space me \space will \space be \space marked \space in \space green.}$ ${\color{orange}Elements \space that \space look \space problematic \space to \space me \space will \space be \space marked \space in \space yellow.}$ (I’ll usually try to add a note of what I think needs to be fixed when using yellow highlighting.) Suggested changes will be made using track changes in Word. (You can review the changes and accept/reject them individually. You can also use accept all, but you should always review all change suggestions to see if they fit with your intended meaning.) It would be helpful to leave topic sentence highlighting, green highlighting, and unfixed problem highlighting in place as we exchange drafts. This will speed up the review process on subsequent drafts. We can remove the highlighting after the final revision of the paper.

# General Suggestions for Improving Writing

* I always recommend the use of Grammarly. Graduate studenta at the U of U have free access. https://gradschool.utah.edu/resources-hub/grammarly/index.php 
* The [Graduate Student Writing Center](https://writingcenter.utah.edu/) is a good resource.
* Understand that writing is an iterative process. Be prepared to complete assignments, receive feedback, and incorporate feedback into revisions.
* You may find it helpful to work on writing assignments in steps.
  * Find relevant content.
  * Group content into logical categories according to the needs of your project.
  * Order your content in a logical sequence according to the needs of your project.
  * Write a rough draft narrative.
  * Work on flow and logic.
  * Edit for publication requirements. (length, style, etc.)
* A lot of final refinement work will consist of evaluating and refining the content and order of your paragraphs.
  * Here are some nice articles on what you should understand about the purpose of paragraphs and how to structure paragraphs.
    * [The Ultimate Guide to Paragraphs](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/paragraphs/) (Ellis, 2021)
    * [How to Write Strong Paragraphs](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/paragraph-structure/) (Ellis, 2021)
    * "You may have learned that every paragraph should begin with a topic sentence and be directly relevant to the section in which it appears. Those are good rules of thumb, but applied too strictly they can make your writing seem stiff. The important thing is to structure and arrange your paragraphs so that they lead your readers through the conversation you are orchestrating. Open each paragraph with a sentence or two that signal its key concepts. Doing that will help readers better understand what follows. If your opening doesn't also state the paragraph's point, then your last sentence should. Never bury the point in the middle." (Booth et al, 2016, p. 195)
  * One exercise you can use to evaluate the quality of your paragraphs and the sequence of your logic is called Reverse Outlining.
