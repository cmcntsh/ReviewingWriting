# Reviewing Writing

This is some information about what I'm usually looking for when reviewing student academic writing.

Here are the things I’m looking for: 

* Section Content (appropriate and complete)
* Evidence (citations used when summarizing, paraphrasing, or quoting)
* APA (spelling, grammar, headings, citation formatting, reference formatting, tables, figures, appendices)
* Logic and Flow (well-formed paragraphs, topic sentences, suitable transitions, logical arrangement, clearly written sentences)

In general I'll use some basic highlighting to denote sections I've reviewed.

${\color{lightgreen}Looks \space good}$ - Things I highlight in green I generally find acceptable.

${\color{orange}Fix \space problem}$ - Things I highlight in yellow I think something needs to be fixed.

${\color{gray}Topic \space sentences \space of \space paragraphs \space will \space be \space highlighted \space in \space gray.}$ Elements that look good to me will be marked in green. Elements that look problematic to me will be marked in yellow. (I’ll usually try to add a note of what I think needs to be fixed when using yellow highlighting.) Suggested changes will be made using track changes in Word. (You can review the changes and accept/reject them individually. You can also use accept all, but you should always review all change suggestions to see if they fit with your intended meaning.) It would be helpful to leave topic sentence highlighting, green highlighting, and unfixed problem highlighting in place as we exchange drafts. This will speed up the review process on subsequent drafts. We can remove the highlighting after the final revision of the paper.

I always recommend the use of Grammarly.
