# Reviewing Writing

This is some information about what I'm usually looking for when reviewing student academic writing.

### Here are the things I’m looking for: 

* Section Content (appropriate and complete)
* Evidence (citations used when summarizing, paraphrasing, or quoting)
* APA (spelling, grammar, headings, citation formatting, reference formatting, tables, figures, appendices)
* Logic and Flow (well-formed paragraphs, topic sentences, suitable transitions, logical arrangement, clearly written sentences)

### Highlighting:

$\colorbox{lightgreen}{Looks good}$ - Things I highlight in green I generally find acceptable.

$\colorbox{yellow}{Fix problem}$ - Things I highlight in yellow I think something needs to be fixed.

$\colorbox{lightgray}{In general I'll use some basic highlighting to denote sections I've reviewed.}$ Topic sentences of paragraphs will be highlighted in gray. $\colorbox{lightgreen}{Elements}$ that look good to me will be marked in green. I'll usually just mark the first word of sentences. $\colorbox{yellow}{Elements}$ that look problematic to me will be marked in yellow. (I’ll usually try to add a note of what I think needs to be fixed when using yellow highlighting.) Suggested changes will be made using track changes in Word. (You can review the changes and accept/reject them individually. You can also use accept all, but you should always review all change suggestions to see if they fit with your intended meaning.) It would be helpful to leave topic sentence highlighting, green highlighting, and unfixed problem highlighting in place as we exchange drafts. This will speed up the review process on subsequent drafts. We can remove the highlighting after the final revision of the paper.

# General Suggestions for Improving Writing

* I always recommend the use of Grammarly. Graduate students at the U of U have free access. https://gradschool.utah.edu/resources-hub/grammarly/index.php 
* (new in 2023) ChatGPT (https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) can also help fix problem sentences and more. Here are some [examples](https://github.com/cmcntsh/UseChatGPtEdit) of things I've tried.
* The [Graduate Student Writing Center](https://writingcenter.utah.edu/) is a good resource.
* Understand that writing is an iterative process. Be prepared to complete assignments, receive feedback, and incorporate feedback into revisions.
* You may find it helpful to work on writing assignments in steps.
  * Find relevant content.
  * Group content into logical categories according to the needs of your project.
  * Order your content in a logical sequence according to the needs of your project.
  * Write a rough draft narrative.
  * Work on flow and logic.
  * Edit for publication requirements. (length, style, etc.)

### Paragraphs

* A lot of final refinement work will consist of evaluating and refining the content and order of your paragraphs.
  * Here are some nice articles on what you should understand about the purpose of paragraphs and how to structure paragraphs.
    * [The Ultimate Guide to Paragraphs](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/paragraphs/) (Ellis, 2021)
    * [How to Write Strong Paragraphs](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/paragraph-structure/) (Ellis, 2021)
    * [On Paragraphs](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/paragraphs_and_paragraphing/index.html) (Purdue Online Writing Lab, 2022a)
    * "You may have learned that every paragraph should begin with a topic sentence and be directly relevant to the section in which it appears. Those are good rules of thumb, but applied too strictly they can make your writing seem stiff. The important thing is to structure and arrange your paragraphs so that they lead your readers through the conversation you are orchestrating. Open each paragraph with a sentence or two that signal its key concepts. Doing that will help readers better understand what follows. If your opening doesn't also state the paragraph's point, then your last sentence should. Never bury the point in the middle." (Booth et al, 2016, p. 195)
    * "There is no minimum or maximum sentence length in APA Style. Overuse of short, simple sentences produces choppy prose, however, and overuse of long, involved sentences results in difficult, sometimes incomprehensible, language. Varied sentence length helps readers maintain interest and comprehension. When involved concepts require long sentences, the components should proceed logically. Avoid including multiple ideas in a single sentence; instead, break the sentence into shorter ones. Direct, declarative sentences with simple, common words are usually best.
Similar cautions apply to paragraph length. Single-sentence paragraphs are abrupt and should be used infrequently. Paragraphs that are too long (i.e., longer than one double-spaced manuscript page) risk losing readers' attention. A new paragraph signals a shift to a new idea and provides a pause for readers - a chance to assimilate one step in the conceptual development before beginning another. Look for a logical place (or places) to break up a long paragraph or reorganize the material." (American Psychological Association, 2020, p. 115)
  * One exercise you can use to evaluate the quality of your paragraphs and the sequence of your logic is called Reverse Outlining.
    * [Reverse Outlining: An Exercise for Taking Notes and Revising Your Work](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/the_writing_process/reverse_outlining.html) (Purdue Online Writing Lab, n.d.)
    * [Reverse Outlines: A Writer's Technique for Examining Organization](https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/process/reverseoutlines/) (The Writing Center, n.d.)
    
### Sentences
    
* This work will also consist of evaluating and refining your sentences.

  * [How to Write Excellent Sentences: A Guide to Sentences Structure](https://blog.streetwriters.co/how-to-write-good-sentences/) (Streetwriters, 2021)
  * (new in 2023) ChatGPT (https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) can also help fix problem sentences.
    
### Professional Voice

* [Tone in Business Writing](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/tone_in_business_writing.html) (Purdue Online Writing Lab, 2022)
* [How to Make Writing Sound More Professional](https://www.grammarly.com/business/learn/how-to-make-your-writing-sound-more-professional/) (Grammarly Business, 2021)

### Working with References

* If you are citing more than a handful of sources in your writing, I recommend using a citation manager. If you're a student at the University of Utah, EndNote is available for a reasonable cost from the [Office of Software Licensing](https://software-catalog.app.utah.edu/product/1076).
* If you're citing other sources in your writing, you need to come up with a system to keep track of your notes and material you use from your references. Here is a demonstration of keeping source notes using [Miro](https://miro.com/). https://youtu.be/jnGM-j52Rss
